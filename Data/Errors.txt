;Parser Error Messages
;=====================

;Each entry begins with an equal sign (=)
;The lines are:
;Error name
;Error message, which can accept format specifiers
;Help text. Help text can span multiple lines until the next error-name line

;Lines beginning with a semi-colon are ignored. This includes within help text. Beware.
;Leading whitespace will be trimmed from Message and Help lines.
;    Indentation makes the file easier for humans to read
;WARNING: Error names are used by self-tester. Do NOT change them
;Items are listed in the same order as the TQuicheError enumeration defined
;in Parse.Errors
