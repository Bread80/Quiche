Typing and Operators
------

+ operator (for example)
if left and right are U8, op is U8 and result is U8
if left and right are U16, op is U16 and result is U16
Otherwise, op is S16 and result is S16

+# (result size specifier)
This specifies that the result with be U16
The operation will depend on operand types



Types When Parsing Constant Expressions
100 - Byte
1000 - Word
-100 - Int8
-1000 - Int16
type will be 'Implicit' until either:
A negative value is read, or a negative intermediate product, in which case the
type will become explicitly signed
A hex of binary value is read, in which can the value will become expicitly unsigned
An explicitly signed value will become an implictly unsigned value again if any intermediate 
value is positive

procedure a
var x#
begin
  x:=1
end

var y#
begin
  y:=10
end.
